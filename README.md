# Simulating-Quantum-Dots

Quantum  Dots(QD’s)  are  semiconducting  nanoparticles,  they  show  exceptional  optical,chemical and electronic properties which have hundreds of industrial applications.  Core-Shell quantum dots provide an advantage over normal Quantum Dots and their properties can  be  altered  and  controlled  by  varying  the  thickness  of  core  or  the  shell.   This  report is about how these nano particles can be synthesised, how the electrons and holes behave  when the thickness of shell is varied,while keeping the thickness of the core same(1.75 nm) and finally we talk about the how these QD’s can be used industrially.The radius of the Quantum Dots is roughly below the Bohr’s exciton radius,which leads to the motion of the excitons being confined also known as Quantum Confinement.  This further leads to the Qunatizations of the Conductance band(CB) and the Valence Band(VB)which is almost continuous for the Bulk Semiconductors.The synthesis of the QD’s is done via chemically processes where the thickness of the shell can be varied by changing the amount of the compounds used.  The thickness of the shell and the core can be determined by using Transmission electron Microscope.For the analysis of the wave functions of type-1 and type-2 excitons the Hartree Fock mean field approximation has been used, the equations obtained have been further solved using finite difference method.  The Probability density function of the electron and the hole are used to calculate the excitation energy and the bonding energy.The applications of Quantum Dots are being researched immensely and these are the possible applications :  solar cells, LEDs, lasers, single-photon sources, quantum computing, cell biology research, microscopy, and medical imaging.  This report will mainly focus on how we can use QD’s in order to increase the efficiency of solar cell by increasing the amount of light absorbed by the cell.

## QUantum Dots a deeper look 
Quantum Dots are semiconducting nanocrystalline materials with diameter in range of a few nanometers(2-10nm). They use \textbf{quantum confinement } in order to show unique properties. 
### Quantum Confinement
The spatial confinement of electron hole pair due to quantizations in quantum mechanics is known as quantum confinement. This is mainly shown by semiconductor materials as they already posses band gaps.
Metals do not have band gaps due to which quantum confinement is less prevalent. 

As the size is reduced, the delocalized energy states gets confined. The electron hole pairs gets confined as the diameter of the particle approaches the bohr radius. This results in increase in the energy gap. 

In order to change and control the properties of these QDs we need to alter the band gap.
